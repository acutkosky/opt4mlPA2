# EC500 PA2

This homework assignment investigates implementing Adam and a few variants. We will be testing your optimizers on a simplified implementation of [GPT](https://github.com/openai/gpt-3) based on the [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) repository by Andrej Karpathy. This is a model that takes as input a sequence of characters from a text file and attempts to predict the next character. This can be used to generate novel text by starting with a seed text string, and then repeatedly using the model to generate another character.

## Instructions

(these instructions assume you are using google Colab. If you do something else, you are on your own.)
